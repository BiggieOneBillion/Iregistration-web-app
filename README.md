# Front-End Section Of The Event Registration Website

This project is built using React Js, react-router-dom for routing and navigation state management, react-icons for the icons, tanstack query for the async state (server state) management and zustand for logical state management, react-hook-form for form state management.

So I visited one of my friends who is a full-time event planner, and i saw that he struggled to keep track of his events as he used a note pad to fully document and manage his events. So I asked him about the challenges he had, especially about managing and documenting the whole process and luckily, he told me what his experience was like, so I decided to build something that would help solve some of the problems he outlined hence this project.
